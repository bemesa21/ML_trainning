# User-skill clustering
Given a group of users with diferent proficiency levels of skills, we want to find working groups; people with similar affinities and levels.

## Information 
For data clustering, we use the *SciPy* library, it performs hierarchical clustering.
Hierarchical clustering is a method of unsupervised learning that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. 

## Libraries
- pandas
